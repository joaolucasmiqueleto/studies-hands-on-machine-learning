    "In general, Machine Learning can be defined as the ability of a computer to learn something without being explicitly programmed to do so. Given a set of data $E$ and a task $T$, the Machine Learning algorithm will use the data to train and identify patterns that enable it to carry out the task $T$. We can say that the algorithm has learned something if its performance in task $T$ improves, as measured by some metric $P$."

    "Machine learning techniques can be applied to a wide range of problems, from simple spam email detection to the detection of tumors in brain scan images. Here are some examples of such applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Spam detection in emails: the algorithm can classify a new set of emails as spam or not based on previous data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Speech recognition: the program can recognize audio speech (e.g. on a cellphone) and perform a task accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Image classification: there are many applications of this, including the detection and classification of tumor cells in brain scans.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Revenue forecasting: using previous revenue data, a model can be trained to forecast future revenue, such as for the next year."

In a labeled training set, the algorithm learns from the features and the corresponding target labels.
